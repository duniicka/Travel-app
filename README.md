# Travel-app
Welcome to my Travel-app! Travel-app contains all the necessary information, resources, and materials related to travels. Below is a breakdown of the contents and a guide on how to use them.

The SCSS is organized using the 7-1 Pattern, making it easy to scale and maintain the stylesheets.

##Technologies used:
***HTML**: For structuring the content of the website.
***SCSS**: For styling the web pages, using the 7-1 pattern to keep the styles modular and organized.
***Node.js** & npm: For managing dependencies and compiling SCSS to CSS.

##How to Use
1. **Developing the Project:**
You can modify the SCSS files in the src/ directory. Any changes you make to the SCSS will need to be compiled into CSS by running npm run build.
2. **Adding New Styles:**
When you want to add new styles, create a new SCSS file in the appropriate sub-folder under src/scss/. For instance:
*Add a new component style in src/scss/components/
*Add a new page style in src/scss/pages/
*Modify global variables in src/scss/abstracts/
3. **Compiling SCSS:**
After making changes to the SCSS files, compile them to CSS by running the following command:
```
npm run build
```
